# About The Analysis
The analysis objectives are fully detailed in the analysis documents.

# Situation:
The project revolves around analyzing the Yelp dataset, which comprises a subset of businesses, reviews, and user data for academic research purposes. The dataset is extensive, covering 11 metropolitan areas and containing information on over 150,000 businesses and 6.9 million reviews.

# Task:
The objective of the project is twofold. Firstly, to profile and understand the Yelp dataset by addressing a series of questions designed to provide insights into the data. Secondly, to conduct in-depth analysis and draw conclusions on a specific research question chosen by the analyst.

# Action:
For the first part of the project, the analyst engages in data profiling and understanding by examining various aspects of the dataset. This includes exploring the distribution of business hours, comparing the number of reviews between businesses with different star ratings, and analyzing location data to infer potential insights.

# Result:
The analysis yields several key findings. For instance, businesses with higher star ratings tend to have longer operating hours, and there is a significant difference in the number of reviews between businesses with 4-5 star ratings compared to those with 3-4 star ratings. Furthermore, location data may offer additional insights into the differences between these two groups of businesses.

Overall, the project demonstrates the application of SQL and data analysis techniques to gain insights from the Yelp dataset, providing valuable information for academic research and practical use cases such as developing mobile apps or learning natural language processing.
